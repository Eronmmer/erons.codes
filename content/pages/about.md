Incase you were wondering, my full name is Aigbiluese Eronmonsele. Yeah, you probably had a hard time trying to pronounce that. That's why people just call me Erons. I'm a software developer who spends most of his time sleeping and watching movies. 

I build stuff that work on the web and mobile mostly with JavaScript. What that means is, I make web apps and mobiles apps with JavaScript and related technologies. Here, I write down stuff mainly about frontend and backend web development and I hope you enjoy them :). Feel free to [contact](./contacts) me if you're interested in my thoughts on something or just wanna say hi.
